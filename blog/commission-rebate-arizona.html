      <h1>How Commission Rebates Work in Arizona (Simple Explanation)</h1>
      <div class="post-meta">Published Feb 2026 • ~6 min read</div>

      <p>A <strong>commission rebate</strong> is when the buyer’s agent gives you a portion of their commission back at closing...</p>

      <div class="blog-callout">
        <strong>Quick example:</strong><br>
        On a $500,000 purchase, a 1–2% rebate can be a meaningful credit toward closing costs (shown on the settlement statement).
      </div>

      <h2>Where the rebate comes from</h2>
      <p>In a typical purchase, the seller (or builder) pays a commission that is split between agents...</p>

      <h2>How it shows up at closing</h2>
      <p>Most commonly, it’s reflected as a buyer credit or commission adjustment...</p>

      <h2>Does it reduce your cash to close?</h2>
      <p>Often yes, because it offsets closing costs/prepaids. If financing, lender rules can limit how credits apply.</p>

      <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The rebate figures presented on this website are based on a seller paid buyer broker compensation of 3-4% of the sales price. If the seller paid buyer broker compensation is less than 3.5% of the sales price, your rebate will be less than 2%. The minimum buyer broker compensation amount for the agents participating in this program is 1.5% or $4,500 whichever is higher. If your purchase price is under $300,000 or the seller pays less than a 3.5% buyer broker commission, your rebate will be less than 2%. If the seller does not pay a buyer broker commission, the buyer will fulfill the minimum buyer broker compensation amounts of $4,500 or 1.5% of the sales price, whichever is higher. Depending upon specific loan programs or financing, rebate figures may also be affected based on interested party contribution guidelines, please consult with a lender regarding program guidelines. All rebates are credited to the buyers settlement statement upon a successful close of escrow and not before. Rebate program valid to 12/31/2025 or until expiration of signed buyer broker agreement with participating agent.</p>
