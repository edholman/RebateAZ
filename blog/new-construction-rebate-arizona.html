    <h1>Can You Get a Rebate on a New Construction Home in Arizona?</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Updated February 2026 • 7 min read</div>

    <p>
      Short answer: <strong>Yes — in many cases.</strong>
      When buying a new construction home in Arizona, builders often offer buyer agent compensation.
      If structured properly, a portion of that compensation can potentially be returned to you as a rebate at closing.
    </p>

    <div class="blog-callout">
      <strong>Important:</strong><br>
      Your agent typically must be registered with the builder on your very first visit.
      If you walk in without representation, the builder may refuse to pay commission later.
    </div>

    <h2>How Builder Commissions Work</h2>
    <p>
      Most production builders in Arizona budget for buyer agent compensation.
      This compensation is paid from the builder's marketing and sales budget —
      not added on top of your purchase price at the last minute.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a buyer’s agent earns compensation from the builder,
      that agent may choose to rebate a portion of it back to the buyer,
      subject to builder agreement terms and lender guidelines.
    </p>

    <h2>Does the Builder Reduce the Price Instead?</h2>
    <p>
      Typically, no. Builders usually maintain consistent pricing across buyers.
      Instead of lowering the base price, they may offer:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Closing cost incentives</li>
      <li>Rate buydown promotions</li>
      <li>Design center credits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A rebate strategy can sometimes provide flexibility beyond standard builder incentives.
    </p>

    <h2>Real Example</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>$500,000 new build</strong></li>
      <li>Builder offers buyer agent compensation</li>
      <li>If 1% is rebated → $5,000 credit</li>
      <li>If 2% is rebated → $10,000 credit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That credit may reduce your cash to close, offset closing costs,
      or potentially assist with a rate buydown — depending on loan program structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Can You Combine Rebates with Builder Incentives?</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
      Each builder has different policies.
      Some allow both incentives and rebates,
      others cap total concessions.
    </p>

    <h2>What Buyers Often Don’t Realize</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The builder’s sales rep represents the builder — not you.</li>
      <li>Commission is usually already budgeted.</li>
      <li>You typically must register your agent on your first visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Understanding this early can preserve your negotiating leverage.
